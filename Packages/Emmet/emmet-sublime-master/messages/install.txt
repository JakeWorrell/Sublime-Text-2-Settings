Thank you for installing Emmet — a toolkit that can greatly improve your workflow. Note that this plugin automatically downloads and installs PyV8 binary (see status bar message). After PyV8 was downloaded, please restart editor to finish installation process.

Tab key handler
==========================

By default, Emmet allows you to expand abbreviations with Tab key in HTML, XML, HAML and CSS/SASS/LESS/Stylus documents. As a side effect, you can’t use some of your ST2 snippets.

Please read https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#tab-key-handler about how Tab handler works and how to tweak its behavior to match your needs.

Enter key
==========================

In HTML and XML documents, Emmet overrides Enter key to insert formatted line breaks between opening and closing tags. In some cases it will break character input (for example, in Japanese language).

To disable Enter key handler, simply add the following option in your user’s Preferences file:

"disable_formatted_linebreak": true
